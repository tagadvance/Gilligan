# Gilligan

Gilligan is a collection of PHP utilities I have created or gathered over the course of my career.

The implementation of some of these tools was heavily influenced by libraries like [Apache Commons](https://commons.apache.org/) and [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava).

## Download / Install
The easiest way to install Gilligan is via Composer:
```bash
composer require "tagadvance/gilligan:dev-master"
```
```json
{
    "require": {
        "tagadvance/gilligan": "dev-master"
    }
}
```
